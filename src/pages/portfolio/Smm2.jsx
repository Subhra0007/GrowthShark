          <p className="mb-4">
            This was work done recently for a <strong>regional Bengali Language OTT platform</strong>. They were yet to launch their app and they hired Pro-Riterz to build up pre-launch rapport and we did Social Media Marketing for them:

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-sm text-white/90 text-left px-20">
            <li>They didnâ€™t have any Facebook and youtube profiles before they reached us</li>
            <li>They didnâ€™t have huge budgets or ability to spend on multi-channel approach</li>
            <li>They were clear about reaching bengali locals of age 30+</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-black">Challenges before working</h2>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-800">
           Before we started our work, the company was new, didnâ€™t have any online presence and were clueless on how we can build a rapport for them. They were not even clear on how they can work and reach the people to have awareness. We were on the verge of being totally alone and the only support we got was the raw content that they recorded in their studio.
          </p>
        </div>

        {/* Section: Approach */}
        <div className="bg-gradient-to-br from-[#0b223f]/70 to-[#06263f]/50 border border-white/10 rounded-xl p-6 text-center">
          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Our Approach</h2>
          <p className="text-sm text-white/90 mb-4">
           We took the approach of Organic marketing and advised clients to build a presence first and boost up the algorithm with some awareness meta ads later on since CPC will be higher on sales ads.
          </p>
          <p>We routed our efforts into two main channels:</p>
          <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-sm text-white/90">
            <li>Facebook</li>
            <li>YouTube</li>
          </ol>
          <p className="text-sm text-white/90 mt-4">We decided to post atleast 50+ posts in the forms of reels and occasional posts, and circumvented employee advocacy to get the organic rolling. 

          </p>

            Not only this, but Social Media Marketing improvement also improved the Youtube Stats where we posted just shorts and no real long form videos:

          <p className='text-center mb-10 max-w-3xl mx-auto'>We analysed the past 3 monthsâ€™ post trends, types and quality of the competitors in the market and identified how they brand, what kind of content and interest they pour in the videos:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside t text-white/90 space-y-2">
            <li>Keywords were researched and strategically put into the caption body. Even though itâ€™s not as effective and controlled as SEO, it did have some impact due to Social Media Pagesâ€™ and ofcourse Youtubes</li>
            <li>Hashtags are a crucial part of SMM strategy. </li>
            <li>Contents were mostly reels and graphics where these reels had an angle of mystery and caption was accompanied with latest trend on the kind of content</li>
            <li>Content publishing frequency was around 20-30 posts per month</li>
          </ul>
