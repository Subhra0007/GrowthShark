            This was work done recently for an <strong>industrial chiller manufacturer</strong>.
            They were in B2B manufacturing, and we did Social Media Marketing for them:

            Before we started our work, the company was fed up with generic content and no
            engagement per post. They were B2B and wanted to craft their SMM with creative touch and
            solid design that appeals to the masses.

            <li>
             Keywords were researched and strategically put into the caption body. Even though itâ€™s not as effective and controlled as SEO, it did have some impact due to Social Media Pagesâ€™ DR.
            </li>
            <li>
             Hashtags are a crucial part of SMM strategy. We researched three categories of hashtags <strong>Evergreen, Specific & Trending</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Contents were mostly reels and graphics (70%) and rest 30% consisted of <strong>inside the company</strong> content.
            </li>
            <li>Content publishing frequency: 15â€“20 posts/month</li>
          </ul>
